## Introduction

The OAA Development team holds meetings and discusses development work using the [OAA Dev server][1]. Stop by and drop us a line in #general and we'll help you get started contributing! Help channels are for everyone so feel free to stop in and talk shop and post memes in our memes channel. The conversations on the Dev server are project related. Keep all such conversations in the chat as it keeps the channels hopping and you're more likely to get answers to your questions if everyone can read them. Please do not DM members about the project (creeping) - keep it in the chat!

The [OAA Player server][2] is where players meet to find lobbies and play OAA, discuss strategies and share ideas, as well as report bugs. We're always looking for new teams for tournaments, more players for scrims, and welcome any and all constructive feedback. If you do submit a bug report, remember we have a [bug report template][3] that makes it easier for coders to troubleshoot the issue quickly.

See you there!
