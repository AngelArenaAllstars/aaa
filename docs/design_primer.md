#Design Primer

## Boss Concepts
1. When submitting, outline purely the mechanics.
2. Be concise and to-the-point. Don't bother with number-values and lore.
3. Boss fights should last 2 minutes or less (assuming players are of appropiate power level).
4. Bosses should rely heavily on a few interesting active abilities
5. Successfully completing Boss encounters is a function of (learning x reacting).
6. Boss encounters are multistage (3-stages as a rule) becoming increasingly difficult each stage.
7. Each stage adds on top of the previous stage, teaching players the Boss's mechanics before becoming difficult later.
8. Players should understand Bosses' abilities without having to read them.
