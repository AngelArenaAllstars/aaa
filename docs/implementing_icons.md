# Implementing icons

## Items

#### File Locations

Every new item icon must go into the following 3 locations:
- oaa/content/panorama/images/items/custom/... (used for interface stuff)
- oaa/game/resource/flash3/images/items/custom/... (used for the actual item in your inventory)
- oaa/game/resource/flash3/images/spellicons/custom/... (used for items with debuffs)
  - technically not every single item has a buff, I guess, but the files are tiny anyway.
