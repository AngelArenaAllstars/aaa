# Chat commands
Commands to be used for debugging and testing purposes, currently requires the game to either be in tools mode or have sv_cheats 1 enabled. <b>As for now, there is a bug that prevents the chat listener from working on workshop mode, and thus none of these commands will work in upload versions, only in tools mode.</b>
