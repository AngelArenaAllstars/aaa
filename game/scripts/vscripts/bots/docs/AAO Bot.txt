Version 2.0

This is the second version of my OAA bot. It is a complete (hopefully very functional) rewrite of my first bot.

Improvements:
Hero vs Hero fighting is taken over by default AI - I could never write better code than that. I just tell them to walk towards the enemy and fighting AI takes over
The bot knows when it's in a duel and fights almost to the death now since it can't retreat
The Farming is completely taken over by my code and is far more efficient.
A thousand little tweaks and bug fixes.

Bugs:
Some heros will buy 2 shields.
Other unexpected bugs I haven't seen yet.

Lacks:
Boss fighting.
Boss items.
Level ups beyond 25.
AI deciding whether a Hero vs Hero fight is a good idea or not.
They don't pick up items yet.
